/*! \brief If the porting layer detects the enf of frame. For RTU this implies the T3.5 character
 *   timeouts whereas for ASCII the porting layer checks itself on the LF character to
 *   avoid blocking on the read.
 *
 * If this macro is set the MODBUS stack does not internally detect the
 * timeout in RTU mode but depends on the porting layer to call the T35 timeout function.
 * It is passed as an additional argument to the eMBPSerialInit function.
 * For ASCII it does not change the implementation of the stack but the porting layer
 * has to ensure that it does not block after reception of the LF character.
 *
 * For a proper implementation within the serial porting layer it should be noted that.
 *   If the timeout is greater than 1.75ms for baudrates > 19200 baud or
 *   3.5 times the character time (3.5 * 1/baudrate * 11) then this signals the end of the
 *   frame and the function shall be called.
 *   Optionally and even better for full compliance to RTU is that if there is a small gap
 *   between characters exceeding 1.5 times the character time the complete frame shall
 *   be dropped. This needs to be fully implemented in the porting layer and although
 *   required by the standard it is most often ignored.
 *   For ASCII upon reception of the LF make sure that the porting layer does not block within
 *   the read call.
